Oracle Corporation Binary Code License Agreement

for the JAVA SE RUNTIME ENVIRONMENT (JRE) VERSION 6 and JAVAFX RUNTIME

ORACLE  CORPORATION  ("ORACLE")  IS WILLING TO  LICENSE  THE  SOFTWARE
IDENTIFIED BELOW TO YOU ONLY UPON THE CONDITION THAT YOU ACCEPT ALL OF
THE  TERMS  CONTAINED  IN  THIS  BINARY  CODE  LICENSE  AGREEMENT  AND
SUPPLEMENTAL  LICENSE TERMS  (COLLECTIVELY  "AGREEMENT").  PLEASE READ
THE AGREEMENT  CAREFULLY.  BY USING THE SOFTWARE YOU ACKNOWLEDGE  THAT
YOU HAVE READ THE TERMS  AND  AGREE TO THEM.  IF YOU ARE  AGREEING  TO
THESE  TERMS ON  BEHALF  OF A  COMPANY  OR  OTHER  LEGAL  ENTITY,  YOU
REPRESENT  THAT YOU HAVE THE LEGAL  AUTHORITY TO BIND THE LEGAL ENTITY
TO THESE TERMS.  IF YOU DO NOT HAVE SUCH  AUTHORITY,  OR IF YOU DO NOT
WISH TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS, THEN YOU MUST NOT USE THE  SOFTWARE  ON
THIS SITE OR ANY OTHER MEDIA ON WHICH THE SOFTWARE IS CONTAINED.

1.  DEFINITIONS.  "Software"  means  the  identified  above in  binary
form, any other machine readable materials (including, but not limited
to,  libraries,  source  files,  header  files, and data  files),  any
updates or error corrections provided by Oracle, and any user manuals,
programming guides and other  documentation  provided to you by Oracle
under this Agreement.  "General Purpose Desktop Computers and Servers"
means computers,  including  desktop and laptop computers, or servers,
used for general  computing  functions under end user control (such as
but not  specifically  limited  to  email,  general  purpose  Internet
browsing, and office suite  productivity  tools).  The use of Software
in systems and solutions that provide dedicated  functionality  (other
than  as  mentioned   above)  or  designed  for  use  in  embedded  or
function-specific  software  applications, for example but not limited
to:  Software embedded in or bundled with industrial  control systems,
wireless  mobile  telephones,  wireless  handheld  devices,  netbooks,
kiosks, TV/STB, Blu-ray Disc devices,  telematics and network  control
switching  equipment,  printers  and storage  management  systems, and
other  related  systems  are  excluded  from this  definition  and not
licensed under this  Agreement.  "Programs"  means (a) Java technology
applets and applications intended to run on the Java Platform Standard
Edition (Java SE) platform on  Java-enabled  General  Purpose  Desktop
Computers and Servers, and (b) JavaFX technology applications intended
to run on the JavaFX Runtime on JavaFX-enabled General Purpose Desktop
Computers and Servers.

2.  LICENSE  TO USE.  Subject  to the  terms  and  conditions  of this
Agreement,   including,  but  not  limited  to  the  Java   Technology
Restrictions  of the  Supplemental  License Terms, Oracle grants you a
non-exclusive,  non-transferable, limited license without license fees
to reproduce and use internally  Software  complete and unmodified for
the  sole  purpose  of  running  Programs.  Additional   licenses  for
developers  and/or publishers are granted in the Supplemental  License
Terms.

3.  RESTRICTIONS.  Software is confidential and copyrighted.  Title to
Software and all associated  intellectual  property rights is retained
by Oracle and/or its licensors.  Unless  enforcement  is prohibited by
applicable  law, you may not modify,  decompile,  or reverse  engineer
Software.  You acknowledge  that Licensed  Software is not designed or
intended for use in the design, construction, operation or maintenance
of any nuclear facility.  Oracle Corporation  disclaims any express or
implied  warranty  of  fitness  for such  uses.  No  right,  title  or
interest in or to any  trademark,  service mark, logo or trade name of
Oracle or its  licensors is granted under this  Agreement.  Additional
restrictions for developers and/or  publishers  licenses are set forth
in the Supplemental License Terms.

4.  LIMITED  WARRANTY.  Oracle  warrants  to you that for a period  of
ninety (90) days from the date of  purchase, as evidenced by a copy of
the receipt, the media on which Software is furnished (if any) will be
free of defects in materials and workmanship under normal use.  Except
for the  foregoing,  Software  is  provided  "AS IS".  Your  exclusive
remedy and Oracle's entire  liability under this limited warranty will
be at Oracle's option to replace Software media or refund the fee paid
for Software.  Any implied  warranties  on the Software are limited to
90 days.  Some  states do not  allow  limitations  on  duration  of an
implied  warranty,  so the  above may not apply to you.  This  limited
warranty gives you specific  legal rights.  You may have others, which
vary from state to state.

5.  DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.  UNLESS  SPECIFIED IN THIS  AGREEMENT, ALL
EXPRESS  OR  IMPLIED  CONDITIONS,   REPRESENTATIONS   AND  WARRANTIES,
INCLUDING  ANY  IMPLIED  WARRANTY OF  MERCHANTABILITY,  FITNESS  FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR  NON-INFRINGEMENT  ARE DISCLAIMED, EXCEPT TO THE
EXTENT THAT THESE DISCLAIMERS ARE HELD TO BE LEGALLY INVALID.

6.  LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.  TO THE EXTENT NOT  PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN
NO EVENT WILL ORACLE OR ITS LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST  REVENUE,
PROFIT OR DATA, OR FOR SPECIAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
PUNITIVE   DAMAGES,  HOWEVER  CAUSED   REGARDLESS  OF  THE  THEORY  OF
LIABILITY, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE
SOFTWARE,  EVEN IF ORACLE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE  POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.  In no event  will  Oracle's  liability  to you,  whether  in
contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise, exceed the amount
paid  by  you  for  Software  under  this   Agreement.  The  foregoing
limitations  will apply even if the above stated warranty fails of its
essential   purpose.  Some  states  do  not  allow  the  exclusion  of
incidental  or  consequential  damages, so some of the terms above may
not be applicable to you.

7.  TERMINATION.  This Agreement is effective  until  terminated.  You
may terminate  this  Agreement at any time by destroying all copies of
Software.  This  Agreement will terminate  immediately  without notice
from  Oracle  if you  fail  to  comply  with  any  provision  of  this
Agreement.  Either  party may  terminate  this  Agreement  immediately
should any Software  become, or in either party's opinion be likely to
become,  the subject of a claim of  infringement  of any  intellectual
property  right.  Upon  Termination,  you must  destroy  all copies of
Software.

8.  EXPORT  REGULATIONS.  All Software and  technical  data  delivered
under this  Agreement are subject to US export control laws and may be
subject to export or import regulations in other countries.  You agree
to comply strictly with all such laws and regulations and  acknowledge
that you have the  responsibility  to obtain such  licenses to export,
re-export, or import as may be required after delivery to you.

9.  TRADEMARKS  AND LOGOS.  You  acknowledge  and agree as between you
and Oracle that Oracle owns the  ORACLE,  SUN,  SOLARIS,  JAVA,  JINI,
FORTE, and iPLANET  trademarks  and all ORACLE,  SOLARIS,  JAVA, JINI,
FORTE, and iPLANET-related  trademarks, service marks, logos and other
brand designations  ("Oracle Marks"), and you agree to comply with the
Third    Party    Usage     Guidelines     currently     located    at
http://www.oracle.com/html/3party.html  Any use you make of the Oracle
Marks inures to Oracle's benefit.

10.  U.S.  GOVERNMENT   RESTRICTED   RIGHTS.  If   Software  is  being
acquired  by or  on  behalf  of  the  U.S.  Government  or  by a  U.S.
Government prime contractor or  subcontractor  (at any tier), then the
Government's rights in Software and accompanying documentation will be
only as set forth in this Agreement; this is in accordance with 48 CFR
227.7201   through   227.7202-4  (for   Department  of  Defense  (DOD)
acquisitions)   and  with  48  CFR  2.101  and  12.212  (for   non-DOD
acquisitions).

11.  GOVERNING  LAW.  Any action  related  to this  Agreement  will be
governed by  California  law and  controlling  U.S.  federal  law.  No
choice of law rules of any jurisdiction will apply.

12.  SEVERABILITY.  If any  provision of this  Agreement is held to be
unenforceable, this Agreement will remain in effect with the provision
omitted, unless omission would frustrate the intent of the parties, in
which case this Agreement will immediately terminate.

13.  INTEGRATION.  This Agreement is the entire agreement  between you
and Oracle relating to its subject matter.  It supersedes all prior or
contemporaneous   oral   or   written    communications,    proposals,
representations  and warranties and prevails over any  conflicting  or
additional  terms  of  any  quote,  order,  acknowledgment,  or  other
communication  between  the parties  relating  to its  subject  matter
during the term of this  Agreement.  No modification of this Agreement
will be  binding,  unless  in  writing  and  signed  by an  authorized
representative of each party.
